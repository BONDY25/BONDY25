I have the most experience with C# but have a pretty good understanding of most languages.
I spent most of my further education studying engineering and then somehow feel into systems, data science and IT.
Completed a 2 year software development apprenticeship and now here I am.

Recently jumped into Web-Dev and JavaScript, I think I know what I'm doing... but my Google search history might not show it.
